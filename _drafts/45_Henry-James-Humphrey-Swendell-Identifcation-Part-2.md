In October 2022 I managed to visit [Winchester Archives](https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/archives) which allowed me to review the [serjeant's mess portrait](/swendell/Serjeants-Mess-Portrait-Listing) in person. The back of the portrait had the following writing - *Sjt Mess 1st Bn Canada about 1866 to 1870*

The photo had been catalogued as having been taken in 1868. It seems entirely reasonable to me pick the mid year of a range when you're trying to decide which year to attribute an item to. The date range may help explain why in the 1868 serjeant's mess listing there were 46 members, but the photo has 48 portraits. i.e. the photo wasn't taken in 1868.

I returned to the [National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) in March 2023 to review the Rifle Brigades muster books from 1866 to 1870 to see if there was a time when there were 48 members of the Serjeants' mess.
