#Style guide

* Shortened names in titles and navigation sidebar to save space and to allow consistency so that the user knows which page they're on in the navigation bar
* First mention in text give full name, year of birth and year of death. Year of birth and year of death should be presented in the form (xxxx - yyyy)
* If the page relates to an individual then the title is their shortened name followed by a dash and then a brief description of the content of the article
* Adding a new page make sure that it's prefixed with a number that it'll navigate correctly through the previous and next buttons. Add it into navigation.yml in the right place given the number it's been assigned.
