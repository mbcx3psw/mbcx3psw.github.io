William Sewell Swendell (1781 - 1844) is my great, great, great grandfather. One of his sons is Henry Swendell, my great, great grandfather.

William was born in about 1781 and baptised on the 9th of December 1781 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clement_Danes">Saint Clement Danes in Westminster</a>.

He had two wives, Elizabeth Benjamin (1784 - 1819) and Catherine Curtis (1798 - 1882) who bore him five and ten children respectively.

William was highly educated for the time as he was able to read and write and worked as a solictor's clerk. He also appears to have been well connected as he was a member of the masons.

Two, possibly three, of his sons were sent to Australia as convicts. Two other sons fought in the Crimean War. One son was killed after being run over by a carriage.
