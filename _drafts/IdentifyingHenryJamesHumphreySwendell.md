I don't know about other people, but finding a picture of an ancestor is best thing for me about family history research. Having a photo of someone makes them that bit more real and relatable. Photography was invented in 1839. As the 19th century progressed photography became more widespread. For example,<a href="http://1815-1918.blogspot.com/2010/07/rifle-brigade-in-crimea.html">photographs were taken of Rifle Brigade soldiers in the Crimean War</a>. This got me thinking, was there a picture of Henry Swendell out there?

The Rifle Brigade was amalgamated with other regiments to form the Green Jackets Brigade in 1958 and then the Royal Green Jackets Regiment in 1966. The <a href="https://rgjmuseum.co.uk/">Royal Green Jackets Regiment's museum is in Winchester</a> with the regiment's archives managed by <a href="https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/archives">Hampshire Archive</a>. Searching the Hampshire Archive's online index I came across <a href="https://calm.hants.gov.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=A12170%2f3%2f1%2f2%2f1%2f627&pos=274">a photo of the Rifle Brigade's 1st battalion sergeants mess taken in 1868<a/>. Based on Henry's service record his portrait should be on here. Unfortunately the portraits didn't come with a key so I don't know which one is Henry. I have photos of three of Henry's sons and two of his daughters so I started to see if I could spot any family resemblance. I quickly decided this wasn't going anywhere because the portraits weren't very clear and Victorian fashion meant there was a lot of facial hair.

Examining the photos made me realise that in most of them you could make out the soldier's medals pinned to their chest. Based on Henry's service record I knew that he had been awarded the British Crimea War medal and the Turkish Crimea War medal. This narrowed down the number of possible candidates, but not so that I could identify Henry.

In trying to find out more about Henry I'd recently found out about regimental muster books held at the National Archives. Amongst other things muster books were used to track soldiers' pay which is split out by rank. Following a post lock down visit to the National Archives to look at the Rifle Brigade's muster books from 1868 I had a listing of all of the sergeants, including Henry, in the 1st battalion.

After struggling with copper plate writing and some imaginative thinking I came up with the following list of members of the Rifle Brigade 1st Battalion's serjeant's mess.

30 - Walter Eales. Make out DCM and Médaille Militaire. Médaille Militaire a bit tenuous, but it is longer than normal medals and ribbon to right of DCM looks right.
37 - James Hawksford. If 30 is Walter Eales then 37 is James Hawksford as DCM ribbon is distinctive. Also has more than a passing resemblance to James Hawksford - https://www.yeomenoftheguard.co.uk/hcd3c12c9#&gid=1416821204&pid=17

45 - James O'Neill. Can't rely on service records as these are only from when the soldier joined the Rifle Brigade. See James O'Neill. Make out Legion of Honour.

The John Andrews descrepancy is that the photo was reportedly taken in 1868, the muster book records has him in as serving in 1868, but his service record has him leaving the army in 1866.
