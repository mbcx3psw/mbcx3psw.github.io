In my last blog post I identfied three members of the Rifle Brigade's 1st Battalion Serjeants' mess from 1868; James Hawksford, Walter Eales and James O'Neill

I'd also identified possibilities for Henry with two medals at positions 6, 19, 26 (could there be 3 medals?), 28, 29 and 47.

Identified three people
Identified people with two medals. Any of these could be Henry.
Trying to work out order of portraits given the people I've identified. Alphabetically and rank seem unlikely. Possibly length of service. This would explain why James O'Neill is towards the centre. Could just be random in which case I don't stand a chance.

Next step is probably go back to the National Archives and find joining dates for all of the people identified.

Medals not awarded
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_General_Service_Medal - Not awarded until 1899

What other medals could have been awarded?

What's the breakdown of medals visible in the portraits?
What's the breakdown of medals based on the service records?
    Where I have medal listings the breakdown is:
|No. of medals| Count |
|0|17|
|1|0|
|2|7|
|3|3|
|4|2|

Two of these are from Rifle Green in the Crimea and may not have all of the medals awarded in their career. This totals 29. One of the records from Rifle Green I've identified as Walter Eales based on his DCM. There are 17 soldiers in the muster rolls that I have no record of medals and service dates.


Next steps
Return to National Archives to 
* Identify when soldiers joined up based on muster rolls. This would test the theory that portraits are ordered by length of service.
* Review medal rolls to confirm numbers in service records and Rifle Green in Crimea.


30 - Walter Eales. Make out DCM and Médaille Militaire. Médaille Militaire a bit tenuous, but it is longer than normal medals and ribbon to right of DCM looks right.
37 - James Hawksford. If 30 is Walter Eales then 37 is James Hawksford as DCM ribbon is distinctive. Also has more than a passing resemblance to James Hawksford - https://www.yeomenoftheguard.co.uk/hcd3c12c9#&gid=1416821204&pid=17

45 - James O'Neill. Can't rely on service records as these are only from when the soldier joined the Rifle Brigade. See James O'Neill. Make out Legion of Honour.

The John Andrews discrepancy is that the photo was reportedly taken in 1868, the muster book records has him in as serving in 1868, but his service record has him leaving the army in 1866.

Go back to National Archives and find a serjeants mess listing that has 48 people on it.
