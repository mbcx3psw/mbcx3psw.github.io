During the lockdown I started to research my family tree. It's been a lot of fun and I've learnt a lot.

I've found that reading about family history can be pretty dry no matter how thrilling the underlying story. For me the exciting part of family history is when I make a discovery or uncover something unexpected. While I want to use this website as an opportunity to document what I've found out about my family I also want to convey the process I went through and some of the excitement I felt when I found out something new.

My family tree is online at <a href="https://www.ancestry.co.uk/family-tree/tree/168885868/family?cfpid=242186374595">Ancestry</a> and I can be contacted at <a href="javascript:location='mailto:\u0070\u0061\u0075\u006c\u002e\u0077\u006f\u006f\u0074\u0074\u006f\u006e\u0040\u0079\u0061\u0068\u006f\u006f\u002e\u0063\u006f\u002e\u0075\u006b';void 0"><script type="text/javascript">document.write('\u0070\u0061\u0075\u006c\u002e\u0077\u006f\u006f\u0074\u0074\u006f\u006e\u0040\u0079\u0061\u0068\u006f\u006f\u002e\u0063\u006f\u002e\u0075\u006b')</script></a>.
