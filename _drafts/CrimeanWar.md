title: Henry James Humphrey Swendell and the Crimean War

---

Having found out that Henry had been a soldier the next thing to do was get hold of his service record. Luckily this proved to be very simple at <a href="fold3.com">fold3.com</a> and in next to no time I was looking at it. The first page of his service record lists his medals

So that's Alma, Balaclava, Inkermann and the Siege of Sevastopol plus the Turkish Medal.

When I read this I didn't know what these battles and siege were, but a quick bit of googling later it became clear that Henry had fought at the main battles of the Crimean War as a member of the Rifle Brigade! Wikipedia has excellent pages on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea_Medal">British Crimea War medal</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Crimea_Medal">Turkish Crimea War medal</a>

Was there anything else that Henry's service record could tell me about his time in the Crimean War? On the second page the detailed statement of the services table records that Henry joins the 60th Foot regiment on the 18th of July 1852. On the 1st of April he transfers to the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. Context of why he did this.

The next entry states that he deserted from the 4th of September 1855 to the 26th of September 1855. The Crimean War ran from the 16th of October 1853 till the 30th of March 1856. Henry deserted during the Crimean War. If you deserted during the Crimean War you were shot plus where did you desert to in the Crimea to return just over three weeks later? Luckily it looked as if the Rifle Brigade muster books at the National Archives would be able to provide some answers on this as were the record books for the regiment including a listing of all the men.

On my first trip to the National Archives I found the record of Henry's desertion. He had left the Crimea on the .... and was recruiting in the UK in ..... Unfortunately there's no record of why he deserted.

I was short of time on my first visit to the National Archives so I decided to return to find out when Henry had travelled to and from the Crimea. After looking at a couple of muster books I realised that there was another Swendell, Thomas, recorded in the Rifle Brigade's muster books.

A quick check of my family tree on ancestry.com showed that Henry had had a brother called Thomas and that I'd been unable to find him after his marriage to Mary Canavan in Bethnal Green on the 19th of February 1854. Further review of the muster books I found that Thomas had been wounded on the 11th of December 1854 which was at the time of the battle of Inkermann. He died on the 1st of March 1855.

The Crimean War is notorious for the hardship that the soldiers endured. For Henry this must have been made worse by the death of his brother. It's impossible to know how much time Henry and Thomas spent together in the Crimean War. As they were in the same battalion they must have seen each fairly regularly. By the winter of 1854 wounded British soldiers were being treated better than at the start of the conflict thanks to the efforts of Florence Nightingale and her nurses. Sadly this better treatment didn't save Thomas. It's impossible to know whether Thomas' death was a factor in Henry's desertion, but it seems possible.
