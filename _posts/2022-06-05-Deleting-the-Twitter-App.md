title: Deleting the Twitter App

---

I'm writing this for me to capture why I took the decision to delete the Twitter app from my phone and what I think I've got from it. If it helps anyone else who is in a similar position to me and provides them with some perspective then that's great too.
	
Based on next to no data I imagine that I used Twitter like most people. I'd lurk on the edges watching tweets go by, like a few, retweet a few and, occasionally, if I really liked something or I was really annoyed by something I'd tweet myself. I wasn't looking to build up a large number of followers or create a brand I was just there as a consumer.

And Twitter is great. There's lots of great, unique content. One of my favourite accounts is <a href="https://twitter.com/stuarthumphryes">@StuartHumpheys</a> which enhances and sharpens over 100 year old colour photos. As far as I know these pictures aren't posted anywhere else and I really enjoy looking at them. There is also a lot of funny content on Twitter that isn't available anywhere else. This ranges from videos that look as if they're professionally made or a one liner that has gone viral. All really great stuff.

My problem with Twitter is you're never too far away from something negative. I'm not just talking about conspiracy theory nonsense or individuals spouting inflammatory statements for attention, but normal people letting off steam or someone responding to a tweet that they disagree with.

Because it was on my phone it was always available. If I had a couple of minutes to kill I'd see what was on Twitter. Very quickly I'd find something negative. I'd get annoyed by something, put my phone down, a few minutes later look again to see if there's something new and interesting, but instead find something else annoying. This lead to a general background noise of being annoyed at other people's inability to understand a problem or the general lack of politeness.

I slowly realised that this general background noise of negativity was starting to impact my real world relationships. I'd get annoyed that people couldn't see my point of view or were initially resistant to ideas that I was suggesting. I believe that this was a consequence of the background noise of annoyance based on what I was reading on Twitter.

Over a period of months I internally debated the merits of the cool, interesting stuff on Twitter versus the background noise of negativity. I always decided that the cool, interesting stuff was worth the background noise until one day I decided it wasn't. I don't recall there being one defining moment or tweet where I decided enough was enough, but I did get there. To fill the void that I thought I would be left with I searched for RSS feeds for Twitter accounts with websites. Where content was unique to Twitter I moved those accounts over to <a href="https://fritter.cc">Fritter</a>, an open source Twitter account that can be set up just to follow an account's tweets. I then deleted the Twitter app.

To be honest I wasn't entirely convinced by the background noise of negativity argument when I was deciding whether to delete the Twitter app. A couple of months down the line I am 100% convinced. I'm happier and despite being a bit twitchy for the first couple of days I don't miss the Twitter app at all. My decision to delete the Twitter app coincided with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> going viral and a general up swell in interest for online word games. <a href="https://www.quordle.com">Quordle</a>, <a href="https://wafflegame.net/">Waffle</a>, <a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/">Worlde</a> and <a href="https://globle-game.com">Globle</a> have filled those two minute gaps where I'm looking to kill time. At least when I play those games I feel I'm learning something.

Given my experience if you're thinking of coming off Twitter you should definitely try it for a week. Fritter allows you to keep in touch with unique Twitter content, but in a way that you're in much more in control of what you see. I'd also suggest identifying things on your phone that can fill those two minute gaps so you aren't tempted back.
