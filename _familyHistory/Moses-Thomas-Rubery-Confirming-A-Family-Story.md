One of the aspects I've enjoyed about researching my family history is the chance to better understand stories that I've heard down the years. One such story is that of my great great granddad Moses Thomas Rubery (1840 to 1879).

Over the years my dad would tell the story of an ancestor who had met a rather gruesome death. While riding a horse this ancestor had been thrown onto some railings. In putting together my family tree and sharing it with my dad he pointed out that it was my great great granddad Moses Rubery who'd been killed in this way. I've searched for newspaper reports of the incident, but I've been unable to find anything. However, I was able to buy Moses death certificate from the <a href="https://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/login.asp">General Register Office</a>.

Moses' injuries appear to be consistent with being thrown from a horse. The death certficate records the location of Moses' death as The Green, Bloxwich which still exists today.

Talking about family history encouraged my dad to contact one of his cousins who passed onto him the picture below.

I don't think there's any doubt whose shop they're outside! On the balance of probability the family group to the right of centre is the Ruberys with Moses on the left next to his eldest daughter Florence. The smaller girl is Moses' other daughter Beatrice. Moses' wife Maria holds their youngest child Ernest, my great great granddad. Ernest was born in September 1878 and Moses was killed a year later. Given Ernest's apparent age in the photo it was probably taken just a few weeks before Moses' death.
