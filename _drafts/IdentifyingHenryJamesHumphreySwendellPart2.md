30 - Walter Eales. Make out DCM and Médaille Militaire. Médaille Militaire a bit tenuous, but it is longer than normal medals and ribbon to right of DCM looks right.
37 - James Hawksford. If 30 is Walter Eales then 37 is James Hawksford as DCM ribbon is distinctive. Also has more than a passing resemblance to James Hawksford - https://www.yeomenoftheguard.co.uk/hcd3c12c9#&gid=1416821204&pid=17

45 - James O'Neill. Can't rely on service records as these are only from when the soldier joined the Rifle Brigade. See James O'Neill. Make out Legion of Honour.

The John Andrews discrepancy is that the photo was reportedly taken in 1868, the muster book records has him in as serving in 1868, but his service record has him leaving the army in 1866.

Go back to National Archives and find a serjeants mess listing that has 48 people on it.
