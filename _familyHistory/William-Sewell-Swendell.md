William Sewell Swendell (1781 - 1844) is my great, great, great grandfather. One of his sons is [Henry Swendell](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell), my great, great grandfather.

William was born in about 1781 and baptised on the 9th of December 1781 at [Saint Clement Danes in Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clement_Danes).

He had two wives, Elizabeth Benjamin (1784 - 1819) and Catherine Curtis (1798 - 1882) who bore him five and ten children respectively.

William was highly educated for the time as he was able to read and write and worked as a solictor's clerk. He also appears to have been well connected as he was a member of the masons.

Two, possibly three, of his sons were sent to Australia as convicts. He wrote letters to the king pleading clemency for William and [Frederick](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter). There's no evidence that he did the same for Charles. Maybe William thought he was guilty.

Two of his sons [fought in the Crimean War](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell-and-the-Crimean-War).

Another son was killed after being run over by a carriage.
