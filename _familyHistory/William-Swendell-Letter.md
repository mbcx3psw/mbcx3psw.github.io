William Swendell was born on the 23rd of April 1808 to William Sewell Swendell (1781 - 1844), my great great great grandfather, and William's first wife Elizabeth Benjamin (1784 - 1819).

On the 27th of October 1825 William was [sentenced to transportation for life for stealing a hankerchief](https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?div=t18251027-73). William, his father, wrote a letter to the King pleading for clemency.

William provides a significant description of his family's recent history. The main points from the letter are:

- In 1825 William Swendell was living at No 36 Walbrook Place, Hoxton New Town. This street appears to be have been knocked down and replaced by Fairbank Street between 1868 and 1872 since an [1868 map](http://london1868.com/weller32b.htm) shows Walbrook Place, but it has disappeared by [1872](https://maps.nls.uk/view/103313000#zoom=6&lat=6354&lon=2491&layers=BT).
- William was a clerk to a C Humphreys an attorney. William had worked for C Humphreys for 23 years.
- William's son William was only 17.
- From the age of 2 William was brought up by Penelope Cown, a widow, who lived in Kentish Town. Penelope died when William was 8 and was the sister of C Humphreys.
- C Humphreys lived at [7 Broadway Ludgate Hill](https://maps.nls.uk/view/103313321#zoom=6&lat=4904&lon=10897&layers=BT).
- Working as a clerk William was unable to look after his son.
- William was being educated up until two years ago (presumably until he was 15) before he took on an apprenticeship with a tailor.
- William paid the tailor 12 pounds to take on his son as an apprentice.
- William was held in [a hulk called York as Gosport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_York_(1807)).
- William's third son was run over by a carriage and killed age 11. This was probably Benjamin Sewell Swendell (1814 - 1825) a son from his first marriage.

What's different from [William Senior's letter written ten years later regarding his son Frederick Augustus Swendell](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter) is that there's no suggestion that William Junior is not guilty. Rather this is a plea for clemency.

As for the Humphreys I think that the C stands for Charles as I've found a pair of Siblings Charles and Penelope. Penelope married a William Corne (similar sounding to Cown) who died in 1802 with Penelope dying in 1817. These dates are consistent with the contents of the letter.

The letter wasn't immediately successful as on the 28th of January 1828 Charles Humphrey wrote to the King.

*Esteemed Sir*

*Some time since I presumed the liberty of mentioning to you that I had presented a Petition of William Sewell Swendell (the Father of William Swendell who had been convicted of stealing "Hankerchief and sentenced to be transported for the term of his natural life" and foraying "a mitigation of that sentence so that he might be restored to his disconsolate parents and not be compelled to leave his "native Country" he is now only in the Seventieth year of his age and has been confined on Board His Majesty's Hulkl the York at Gosport for two years and upwards I have made every enquiry respecting his conduct durig his confinement and I have not heard to the Contrary of his being very penitent and shews great contrition for the offence of which he was found Guilty. I have also received several letters from him which exhibit that contrition and that Religious principles and morals have a due impression on his mind. He was to the age of eight years brought up in those principles by one of the best and accomplished of Women who never failed taking him to a place of Worship at Kentish Town but unfortunately at that tender age he was deprived of his Benefactress who had paid so close an attention to his welfare here and hereafter. Since that I took him under my care where he continued until the age of Fifteen when I apprenticed him but unhappily with a man who had no consideration for his morals and he had too much his own liberty by which he got into bad company the fatal result of which was that he was seduced and tempted to accompany the lad (that was tried with him) to commit the offence for which he now suffers. I beg to be permitted to add that I am perfectly satisfied that he is not a youth of vicious and bad habits and should his most gracious majesty be pleased to grant him His most gracious pardon I will undertake to receive him and place him in such a situation as to render him useful and honorable member of Society. His father has been with me as Clerk upwards of Twenty six years a truly honest moral man with a large family of six children and which brings up in the principles of Religion morality and virtue. He begs me most humbly to supplicate you Sir to kindly interfere on behalf of his unhappy son who he will render a deserving object of his majesty's mercy by a life of rectitude and virtue and by his exemplary conduct alonge for his least offences. The Father will presume the liberty of handing this letter and wait your final condescension for an answer at any time you Sir whose please to deiecd. Should you Sir wish to seem me on the subject I will punctually attend your appointment*

*I have the Honor to be Esteemed Sir Your obedient humble Servt*

*C Humphreys*

*7 Broadway Ludgate Hill 22 January 1878*

*PS I beg to enheat Your Pardon for their Liberty and would have done myself the honor of waiting on you in person but I was fearful I should impeede too XXXXX on Your valuable time*

Charles mentions that William Senior has six children. In January 1878 the six children from his second marriage are:

- Frederick Augustus Swendell (1820 - 1836) who in [1835 will encounter similar problems](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter).
- Emma Swendell (1822 - 1882).
- Joseph Corne Swendell (1821 - 1893). Joseph may have been given the middle name Corne as a tribute to Penelope Corne.
- Catherine Elizabeth Swendell (1823 - 1834).
- Jane Ellen Swendell (1825 - 1826).
- Frances Ann Swendell (1827 - ?).

William's next child to be born in 1830 is [Henry James Humphrey Swendell](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell) my great, great grandfather.

There's no record of William Junior arriving in Australia. The first census to record all members of a household wasn't until 1841 and I've not been able to find a record of William Junior. William Senior is recorded in the 1841 census, but he is living with his second wife and their children. There's no record of children from his first marriage living with him and his second wife.
