Consider splitting out into

* Masons and gentleman
* Relationship with Charles Humphreys and Penelope Cown
* Moving around London
* Children's fate
* Summary

William Sewell Swendell (1781 - 1844) is my great, great, great grandfather. One of his sons is [Henry Swendell](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell), my great, great grandfather.

William was born in about 1781 and baptised on the 9th of December 1781 at [Saint Clement Danes in Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clement_Danes).


In 1819 William's wife Elizabeth Benjamin (1784 - 1819) died and was buried on the 8th of February 1819 at [Saint Savior in Southwark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwark_Cathedral). By this time she had born him 5 children.

On the 20th of August 1820 William married Catherine Curtis (1798 - 1882). In 1820 Catherine gave birth to Frederick Augustus (1820 - 1836) and Emma (1820 - 1882). Frederick and Emma were christened at [Saint Sepulchre, Holborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate) on the 27th of August 1820. On the baptism record William's occupation is listed as gentleman once again 16 years after he claimed the same when he joined the Freemasons. Another interesting aspect of the baptism record is that their address is given as 67, Old Bayley, which may be a misspelling of Old Bailey. This address doesn't match with the [letter William wrote in 1835 which states he has been a resident of Hoxton for 25 years](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter). Could 67, Old Bayley be Catherine Curtis' address? [Charles Humphrey's given address in William's letter in 1825 is 7, Broadway, Ludgate Hill](/swendell/William-Swendell-Letter) which is a 5 minute walk from 67, Old Bailey.

William died in 1844 so he only appears on the 1841 census. His children's baptism records are the best means of understanding how his life was changing over time. Where recorded, his occupation switches between gentleman and clerk. All but one of William and Elizabeth's children were christened at [Saint Sepulchre, Holborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Sepulchre-without-Newgate) in Holborn. As already noted William and Catherine's first children were also christened at Saint Sepulchre. This suggests that William was living in central London. Of the remaining eight children he had with Catherine all but one were baptised at [Saint Leonards in Shoreditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonard%27s,_Shoreditch). This is consistent with his children's baptism records which record him living in Hoxton and the statement in his letter to the King asking for clemency for Frederick in 1835 that he had been [living in the parish for the past twenty five years](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter). There's a bit of discrepancy here as his address in 1820 as recorded on Frederick and Emma is 67, Old Bayley which I believe to be in the City of London. However on his son Edwin's birth record in 1811 his abode is recorded as [City Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Road). The east end of City Road is towards Shoreditch. This 1811 record would be consistent with him having lived in Hoxton for 25 years as recorded in the 1835 letter.

So who was William Swendell? I think he was a relatively lowly paid clerk with occasional delusions of grandeur. He seems to have been a hard worker who struggled to provide for his large family.
