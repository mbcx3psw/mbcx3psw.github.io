This is my favourite old family photo. The original is approximately 7cm by 4cm with rounded corners. It isn't mounted and there's nothing written on the back or any markings.

There are a number of reasons why I like it. It's the oldest group photo in our family, it's from a different world and there are a couple of mysteries.

So what do I know?

I know that number 1 is my great granddad Thomas Swendell. Stood next to him at number 2 is his sister, Caroline Swendell. I think that number 3 is probably Caroline's husband Willie Hardwick. Sat down at number 7 is my great grandma Sarah Horsfall alongside her sister Martha Horsfall at number 9. Everyone else is a bit of a mystery.

To try and date the photo I asked at <a href="https://www.rootschat.com">rootschat.com</a> where the <a href="https://www.rootschat.com/forum/index.php?topic=832760.0">general consensus was that it was taken between 1908 and 1912</a>.

This ruled out Rachel Horsfall, my great, great grandma, being the lady at number 4 as she died in 1906. This left me with no idea who numbers 4, 5, 6 and 8 are. I tried to tackle this by focussing on the girl. See looks to be about five in the photo and chances are her parents are in the photo with her. Caroline and Willie Hardwick had no children. The 1911 census confirms this. I started to trawl through my family tree looking for a girl born in about 1903. This was harder than I thought it was going to be.
