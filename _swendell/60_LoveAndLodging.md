## Thomas Swendell and Sarah Horsfall

In the 1901 census Thomas Swendell, my great grandfather is recorded as living with his mother Ann Swendell, his sister Mary Jane (recorded as Polly) and his two nieces Florrie and Elizabeth Duffin in Princess Street. I think this might be a transcription error and they were actually living in *Prince's* Street. In the next ten years there is a lot of upheaval in the family. Ann died in 1906. Elizabeth emmigrated to America with her mother Emily arriving in Boston in 1910. Florrie and Mary Jane move in with Mary Jane's sister Caroline and her husband Willie Hardwick. We'll return to Caroline later. The main reason that I think Princess Street is a transcription error is because Caroline and Willie lived at 4, Alexander Street which is next to Prince's Street.

It was really difficult to find Thomas in the 1911 census because his name had been spelt incorrectly. He was recorded as Thomas Swendle.

So how can I be sure that Thomas Swendle is really Thomas Swendell? Well, the age and place of birth fit, but more convincingly Sarah Horsfall is my great grandma! Thomas' family had been living in Wibsey, south west of Bradford. The Horsfalls lived on Westminster Terrace in the north east of Bradford. I don't know the reasons for Thomas moving to the north east of the city and whether Thomas and Sarah knew each other before he moved in. Anyway, 2 years after the 1911 census on the 18th May 1913 Thomas and Sarah were married at Saint Augustine church.

Four years later, on the 14th of September 1917, Sarah gave birth to Catherine Swendell, my grandma.

## Harold Stewart and Catherine Swendell

Back to Thomas' sister Caroline. On the 18th of February 1928 Mary Jane Stewart married Tom Barker at Saint Paul's church in Wibsey. Mary Jane's address is given in the wedding register as 4, Alexander Street i.e. Caroline and Willie Hardwick's house. Tom Barker is the son of Edwin and Louisa Barker. Louisa's maiden name is Swendell, she's Caroline's elder sister.

It's possible that Mary and Tom met each other while Mary was lodging. Of course it's also possible that Mary was lodging at the Hardwick's having already met Tom.

The final piece of this puzzle is that Mary had a younger brother, Harold Stewart, who is my granddad. In April 1947 Harold Stewart married Catherine Swendell at Saint Paul's church in Wibsey.
