Occasionally you stumble across something that takes your breath away. In this case it's a letter I found on the National Archives website from William Sewell Swendell, Charles Augustus Swendell's father, to the king asking that Charles isn't sent to Australia as a convict.

A transcript of the letter is below.

<p>
To the King's most excellent majesty
</p>
<p>
The Humble Petition of William Swendell of N 38 Reeves Place Hoxton
</p>
<p>
Most Humbly xxxx
That your petitioner is the Father of Frederick Swendell a convict on board your majestys ship Leviathain lying at Portsmouth on a charge of felony.
</p>
<p>
Your petitioner humbly begs leave to state that on the day the robbery was committed (Wednesday the 10th of December instant) his son was never absent from his home more than five minutes at any one time and moreover that he (the convict) being unwell was to bed at an early hour, and as the property was stolen at Hackney a distance of three miles from his dwelling, it is impossible that his for could have been accessory to it - On the day following (Thursday) his son was not out of the home until 12 o'clock when he was accosted by two young men whom he had only known a few days. They invited him to accompany them into the Kingston Road where they induced him to partake of some refreshment at a Public House and requested he would oblige them by offering a sheet to be pawned as they were in want of a few shillings.
</p>
<p>
Your petitioner's son being asked by the pawnbroker where he obtained the sheet said he had it from his mother but on being further interrogated he declared he would tell the truth that the sheet was given him by two lads then at the Cherry Tree public house. A policeman was called and Frederick Swendell given into custody and on seeing this his companions made their escape.
</p>
<p>
Your petitioner's begs further to state that having made enquiry on the night previous to his sons conviction, when the trial would take place he was informed it was sixteen on the list. That he your petitioner attended with xxxx evidence before 10 o'clock on the following morning and to his great grief and dismay learnt that the trial was over and that his son was convicted.
</p>
<p>
Your petitioner therefore humbly implores your gracious majesty will take the case of his xxxx  xxxx son into your majesty merciful considerations.
</p>
<p>
And for which your petitioner is xx duty bound, will for ever pray.
</p>
<p>
W Swendell
