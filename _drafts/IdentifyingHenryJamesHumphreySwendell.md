I don't know about other people, but finding a picture of an ancestor is best thing for me about family history research. Having a photo of someone makes them that bit more real and relatable. Photography was invented in 1839. As the 19th century progressed photography became more widespread. For example,<a href="http://1815-1918.blogspot.com/2010/07/rifle-brigade-in-crimea.html">photographs were taken of Rifle Brigade soldiers in the Crimean War</a>. This got me thinking, was there a picture of Henry Swendell out there?

Typing variations of Rifle Brigade 19th century into Google turns up various results. Imagine how amazing it would be if you were an ancestor of Sergeant Carroll of the Rifle Brigade, you'd simply type his name into Google and <a href="https://www.warhistoryonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/64/2018/11/crimean_war_1854-56_q71641-496x640.jpg">his picture</a> would be there! Unfortunately this didn't happen to me, but I kept looking for Rifle Brigade resources.

The Rifle Brigade was amalgamated with other regiments to form the Green Jackets Brigade in 1958 and then the Royal Green Jackets Regiment in 1966. The <a href="https://rgjmuseum.co.uk/">Royal Green Jackets Regiment's museum is in Winchester</a> with the regiment's archives managed by <a href="https://www.hants.gov.uk/librariesandarchives/archives">Hampshire Archive</a>. Searching the Hampshire Archive's online index I came across a https://calm.hants.gov.uk/Record.aspx?src=CalmView.Catalog&id=A12170%2f3%2f1%2f2%2f1%2f627&pos=274

30 - Walter Eales. Make out DCM and Médaille Militaire. Médaille Militaire a bit tenuous, but it is longer than normal medals and ribbon to right of DCM looks right.
37 - James Hawksford. If 30 is Walter Eales then 37 is James Hawksford as DCM ribbon is distinctive. Also has more than a passing resemblance to James Hawksford - https://www.yeomenoftheguard.co.uk/hcd3c12c9#&gid=1416821204&pid=17

45 - James O'Neill. Can't rely on service records as these are only from when the soldier joined the Rifle Brigade. See James O'Neill. Make out Legion of Honour.

The John Andrews descrepancy is that the photo was reportedly taken in 1868, the muster book records has him in as serving in 1868, but his service record has him leaving the army in 1866.
