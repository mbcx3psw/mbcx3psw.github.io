William Sewell Swendell (1781 - 1844) is my great, great, great grandfather. One of his sons is [Henry Swendell](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell), my great, great grandfather.

William was born in about 1781 and baptised on the 9th of December 1781 at [Saint Clement Danes in Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Clement_Danes).

He had two wives, Elizabeth Benjamin (1784 - 1819) and Catherine Curtis (1798 - 1882) who born him five and ten children respectively.

William is recorded variously as a clerk and gentleman. [While I'm certain he was a clerk I doubt that he was a gentleman](/swendell/William-Sewell-Swendell-Clerk-Freemason-And-Gentleman).

Two, possibly three, of his sons were sent to Australia as convicts. He wrote letters to the king pleading clemency for [William](/swendell/William-Swendell-Letter) and [Frederick](/swendell/Frederick-Augustus-Swendell-Letter). There's no evidence that he did the same for Charles. Maybe William thought he was guilty.

Two of his sons [fought in the Crimean War](/swendell/Henry-James-Humphrey-Swendell-and-the-Crimean-War).

Another son, [Benjamin Sewell Swendell, was killed after being run over by a carriage aged 11](/swendell/William-Swendell-Letter). 

William had seven daughters of which only one, Emma, may have made it to adulthood.

William was buried in 1844 at [Saint John the Baptist in Hoxton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_the_Baptist,_Hoxton).
