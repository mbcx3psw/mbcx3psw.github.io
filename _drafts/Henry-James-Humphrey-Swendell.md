Henry James Humphrey Swendell was born on the 19th of April 1830 in Hackney, London. Henry's mother was Catherine Swendell (nee Curtis). Catherine was Henry's father's second wife. Henry ended up having nine siblings and five half siblings.

Henry served in the Rifle Brigade. He fought in the Crimean War and was posted to Canada. While in Canada a set of portraits was taken of the serjeants' mess. I've spent considerable time on trying to identify which of the portraits is Henry.
